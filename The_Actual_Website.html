<h2>Who is Kelly Olynyk?</h2>
<p>Kelly Olynyk is a center that currently plays for the Miami Heat in the NBA. He was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks in the first round in the 2013 draft, however the Mavericks made the biggest mistake by trading Kelly to the Boston Celtics the same year. The Boston Celtics made the same mistake in the offseason going into the 2017 season. Olynyk is one of the few centers in the NBA that can shoot. </p>
<h2>Why is he the G.O.A.T?</h2>

style="width:521px;height:381px;">
<p>Kelly Olynyk is one of the very few centers in the NBA that can actually make a shot. Most centers are supposed to go in and dunk or shoot layups, Kelly can also shoot the ball. This doesn't mean that he can't drive in and dunk, it just means he is a better all around scorer. Kelly is by far the most balanced center in the NBA at the moment because of everything he can do. Even though Kelly is tall he can still run at a decent pace, I'm not saying that he is the fastest in the league, but he for sure isn't the slowest.</p>
<h2>Kelly's early life</h2>
